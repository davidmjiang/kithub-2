# Pull Requests

With Kithub, teachers can collaborate with each other on their lesson plans by submitting Github style "pull requests" to other teacher's lesson plans. By integrating the JS Diff library, we display deletions and additions to both the pull requestor and the pull requestee. The original lesson plan owner then has the option to accept or reject changes to their master copy of the lesson plan. The owner can accept or reject all changes or pick and chose specific portions to accept. Once a user has accepted a pull request to their copy of the lesson plan, those changes are immediatley be reflected in their lesson. Teachers can also comment on pull requests to resolve any issues or uncertainties. Collaborating on lesson plans has never been easier!
