# Welcome to KitHub

KitHub is designed for teachers. It is a platform for sharing and colloborating on lesson plans, an online gradebook that includes tools not just for tracking student scores, but also visualizing class data and applying grading curves, and finally a scheduling tool for assigning lessons to different class periods. It consists of three separate AngularJS apps backed by a Ruby on Rails API.

## Lesson plans

Each user can post any number of lesson plans, formatted in Markdown. A user can create a new blank plan, or, if preferred, upload a Word document that will be converted.

On the lesson plan page, users may click 'Edit' to alter the contents of the plan, change attributes, and upload additional materials associated with the project. Clicking the 'Save' button commits the changes. On the settings page, a user may delete the lesson or download a copy as a Word document.

Users may also find the lesson plans of others users and fork them. After making edits, these changes may submitted to the original lesson owner, who can then accept or reject the changes. When the original lesson changes, teachers who have forked that lesson will be prompted to accept or reject the changes in their own copy.

## Technical Highlights

### Merging

### Uploading

### Pull Requests

With Kithub, teachers can collaborate with each other on their lesson plans by submitting Github style "pull requests" to other teacher's lesson plans. By integrating the JS Diff library, we display deletions and additions to both the pull requestor and the pull requestee. The original lesson plan owner then has the option to accept or reject changes to their master copy of the lesson plan. The owner can accept or reject all changes or pick and chose specific portions to accept. Once a user has accepted a pull request to their copy of the lesson plan, those changes are immediatley be reflected in their lesson. Collaborating on lesson plans has never been easier!
