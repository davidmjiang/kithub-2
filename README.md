Gradebook overview:

Click on the "Gradebook" link in the navbar to get to the gradebook app. Here you can find everything you need to keep track of classes and grades. Add a course by clicking the "add course" button. After adding a course, students, and assignments, click in a cell in the spreadsheet to edit a student's score on an assignment. Scores default to "-1", indicating that a score should not be considered in calculations of a student's or assignment's grades. 

Add a few students and scores, then click on an assignment's name in the header of the table. A modal window will appear with information about the assignment. From here you can also apply a curve to an assignment's scores. Choose between two different types of curves and watch the data visualizations change in real time as you modify a curve. To save a curve on an assignment, click the "Apply Curve" button. Clicking the assignment name or points possible will allow you to change these values. 

Visualizations of each student's grades are viewable in the modal opened by the "Details" link in the rightmost column in the table. You can also add notes on a student. Now click on the "Gradebook" link in the navbar to return to the course list page. Hover over the icon of a line graph to see a visualization of class performance over time. If a class did exceptionally well or exceptionally poorly on an assignment, you should be able to see it from here and apply curves appropriately. Grades in the line graph are calculated after the curve, so your changes will be immediately apparent. On the page for an individual course, you can send emails to students who are failing by clicking on the "Notifications" button.
