Dear <%=@student.first_name %>,
I would like to inform of your current progress in my class. With the most recent grades, you currently have an overall score of <%= @score %>%.

I am very happy with your current path and just wanted to let you know this. If you would like to talk further, you can reach me through my email at: <%= @teacher.email %>.

Thank you for your time. 

Best,

<%= @teacher.first_name + " " + @teacher.last_name %>
